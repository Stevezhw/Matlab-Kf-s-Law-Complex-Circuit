# Matlab-Kf-s-Law-Complex-Circuit
for my circuit classes use

1. lazy to add converter between properties and reactance. So, regards to the frequency of the power supply, muti a frequency. \
2. because of the proerty of supperposition in circuit, I didn't extend this to muti-voltage supply. It only works for one circuit. 
3. don't forget do reduction for the current supply into voltage supply. 

 -- using # DefineVar.m to define circuit elements. 
 -- using # AdvancedLoop.m to calculate voltage, current: 
                        including: 
                                  frequency domain, rectangular domain, time domain 
 -- calculate complex power as well. using # ComplexPower.m
